#4. Transform each deviation value into an integer "dexterity" [0-10]
#   with 0 representing almost no similarity to the desired path
#   and 10 representing a perfect image of desired path
#5. Label each dataset with its dexterity
#6. Export a csv file in the format SampleName, SampleSize, Dexterity, point1_x, point1,y,...,point[size]_x, point[size]_y
#   for all 328 set of data
